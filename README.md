# CALORIES TRACKER APP

The application was built as a practice project for a JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course with FreeCodeCamp. It features a calorie tracker designed to help users manage their daily calorie intake and expenditure. Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app incorporates basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and validated user inputs. It performs calculations based on those inputs and dynamically updates the interface.
